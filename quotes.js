        quote: `I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.
         From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned 
         and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig 
         was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was 
         Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South Ameri
         -ca, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other 
         lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic 
         lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't
          quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to 
          death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.
           I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest,
            and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black,
             and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.`,

        quote: `It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed
                other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked 
                harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular,
                stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more 
                bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the
                work we didn't do, the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry
                and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself thr
                -ough the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different 
                kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret,
                and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not
                lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret it
                -self. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our
                own and other people's worst enemy. We can't tell if any of those other
                versions would have been better or worse. Those lives are happening,
                it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening
                we have to focus on.`,
